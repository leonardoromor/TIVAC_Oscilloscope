# TIVAC_Oscilloscope
A firmware for the Tiva C microcontroller to send adc data through usb and a frontend application to plot


## New stuff

I was able to use libusb to develop a small usb bulk transfer, in such a way I was able to test the TIVA C lab 7 source code. All usb pc-side code is inside usb folder.
